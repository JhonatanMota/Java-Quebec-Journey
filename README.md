## Git commands

- git add
    -- Moves changes from the working directory to the staging area.
- git checkout
    -- git checkout is also the means to navigate existing branches. 
- git clone
    -- Creates a copy of an existing Git repository.
- git commit
    -- Takes the staged snapshot and commits it to the project history. Combined with git add, this defines the basic workflow for all Git users.
- git pull
    --  Pulling is the automated version of git fetch. It downloads a branch from a remote repository, then immediately merges it into the current branch
- git push
    -- Pushing is the opposite of fetching (with a few caveats). It lets you move a local branch to another repository, which serves as a convenient way to publish contributions. This is like svn commit, but it sends a series of commits instead of a single changeset.
